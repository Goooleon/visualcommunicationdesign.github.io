# Introduction

In this course your will learn how to **analyse**, **evaluate** and **create** various forms of visual communication. The analysis should help you *predict* how people perceive and experience images. You will learn about visual perception and communication (creation of images) and the relation between them. The evaluation should help you *confirm* how people perceive and experience images. This implies empirical investigations using experimental paradigms from experimental psychology. Lastly, we will (obviously) also design visuals ourselves. Because many design students already have quite some sketching experience, and likely used video and photography in previous courses, we will focus on a relatively unexplored technique: sketching with code. Specifically we will use the P5.js, a JavaScript library aimed at artists and designers. 

# Analysis and evaluation

For the theory about perception we will use a reader/book that is currently in draft status. 
[Here](https://homepage.tudelft.nl/w3s80/VCD/VCD_wijntjes_intro.pdf) you can download the pdf of the introduction (about 10mb) and [here](https://homepage.tudelft.nl/w3s80/VCD/VCD_wijntjes_full.pdf) you can download the password projected version (you'll get the password in class).




# Design (Sketching with P5.js)

We will use P5.js for several reasons. When learning visual (interaction) design, there is always the difficult issue of what kind of platform/software to use. There is a wide spectrum ranging from off-the-shelf interaction prototyping software on the one side, and purely coding (e.g. HTML5 etc) on the other hand. 

P5.js seems to be nicely in the middle. On the one hand, it is relatively easy to generate interesting visuals. On the other hand, it can be a good introduction about how things on the web are organized. But **most importantly** using P5.js is really what *sketching* is about: a creative ping-pong game between your mind and the world where many serendipitous occur leading to (literally) unimaginable outcomes. Further advantages include 1) free, 2) great community of artists and designers, 3) access to a wide variety of javascript plugins including machine learning, 4) concrete result because you generate an HTML page (or you can embed it wither via iFrame or just as a javascript). 

## How to sketch

Below you will find instructions to learn how you can code using P5.js, but before that let me quickly highlight the various ways you could use P5.js, specifically for this VCD course. 
* Besides using simple graphical elements, you can also use pictures of fragments of pictures as elements. Cut something out and save as .png so the background is rendered transparent. Also, you could use .svg files, which are vector graphics for the web. 
* Explore all the types of input. It all starts with (mouseX,mouseY) but there are many other cool input variables such as the orientation of your smart phone, microphone sound level and even camera input (including machine learning stuff like face tracking). 
* It is possible to sketch both 2D and 3D (with webGL). As you cab load images, you can also load 3D files (obj) and do interesting things with these. 
* As data input, it is possible to load JSON files, which can be used for data visualization.

[Here](P5.md]) will find links to P5 video tutorials by the creative coding genius [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/). Be aware that some older videos use a different coding interface, you should just do everything in the new [P5 online editor](https://editor.p5js.org). 

Besides watching videos, the best things to do are
* Check out examples in the online editor
* Check out (examples in on p5 website)[https://p5js.org/examples/]
