# Theory

For the theory about perception we will use a reader/book that is currently in draft status. 
* [Here](https://homepage.tudelft.nl/w3s80/VCD/VCD_wijntjes_intro.pdf) you can download the pdf of the introduction (about 10mb) 
* [here](https://homepage.tudelft.nl/w3s80/VCD/VCD_wijntjes_full.pdf) you can download the password projected version (you'll get the password in class).
* Aside from the material we are writing ourselves, there are various interesting books out there. My main recommendation would be [Visual Thinking for Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0123708966/ref=rdr_ext_tmb) by Colin Ware, which has been a major inspiration source when teaching this course over the past years. He also wrote the bit more advanced book [Information Visualization - Perception for Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0123814642/ref=rdr_ext_tmb) that you should certainly check out when diving deeper in the topic of data visualization.
